# helpinghand

This is the codebase for HelpingHand which is an application developed by Paul Kiely
as part of a thesis for a Masters in Software Engineering from NUI Galway.

This application is a Flutter project written in Dart which can be compiled to Kotlin
for use on an Android Device or to Swift for use on an iOS device.

## Getting Started

As this is a flutter project, you will need to install the flutter plugin in Android 
Studio to work on this codebase. This can be added to Android Studio as follows...

File -> Settings -> Plugins
Search for Flutter and install the plugin. This should include the required Dart plugin

After downloading this code from Git to Android Studio the flutter packages and dependencies
will need to be added to the project. This will be completed as part of the build process,
alternatively 'Flutter pub get' can be run from the tools menu as follows...

Tools -> Flutter -> Flutter pub get
